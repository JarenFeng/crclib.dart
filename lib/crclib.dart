/// Generic CRC calculations as Dart converters and some common algorithms.
///
/// The easiest way to use this library is to call `convert` on the instance of
/// the desired CRC routine.
///
///   Crc32Xz().convert(utf8.encode('123456789')) == 0xCBF43926
///
/// Another supported use case is as stream transformers.
///
///   File(...).openRead().transform(Crc32Xz())
///
/// Instead of using predefined classes, it is also possible to construct a
/// customized CRC function with [ParametricCrc] class. For a list of known
/// CRC routines, check out http://reveng.sourceforge.net/crc-catalogue/all.htm.
///
/// TODO:
///   1. inputReflected and outputReflected can be different, see CRC-12/UMTS.
///   2. Bit-level checksums (including non-multiple-of-8 checksums).
